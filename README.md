# Interviewed

_No more using Excel to track interviews, applications, and networking phone calls when applying for a job._

## Why

When I was job hunting in the past, I would open up a clunky Excel file to keep track of application deadlines, people I've spoken to at companies, and any other notes I had. This app serves as a replacement for that interview tracker Excel file.
