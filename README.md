# Interviewed

_No more using Excel to track interviews, applications, and networking phone calls when applying for a job._

## Why

When I was job hunting in the past, I would open up a clunky Excel file to keep track of application deadlines, people I'd spoken to at companies, and any other notes I had. This app serves as a replacement for that interview tracker Excel file.

## What

_Interviewed_ allows you to keep track of your applications, company contacts, and any other notes you have. Sign back in any time to edit your tracker.
